# 28BYJ_48-Rollerblinds-SinricPro

I made this Software to control selfmade motorized Rollerblinds using SinricPro (with the Alexa Skill).
My blinds don't have a limit switch, therefore i implemented an Webinterface to set the Bounds (as step count for the 28BYJ_48) for the Blinds as i dont found a viable solution to set them via Sinric.
Also you can save the current settings to the ESP via SPIFFS in the Webinterface when planning a Restart. I decided not to frequently save the Position Values to minimize Flash wear.
